i see a container, that is centralized
inside it, is a 3 column card with no margin in between them
the cards have the same widths, with different bg colors and some text and  buttons with rounded corners and white borders on it.

i also see in the active state, that when a mouse hovers over the button, it displays as a pointer.

colors used in the page is white and a grayish white color.
